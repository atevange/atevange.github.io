<h2 align = "center" > Where Do I Begin? </h2>

<p> The past seeks the present, the present seeks the future, and the future seeks the past. I was in high school when I made up this statement.
	The reason I mention this was because hate, war, and discrimination were always a part of history.
	I do not like ranting about the past but that is one of the many things that goes through my head from day to day.
	In high school I use to be involved with all sorts of clubs and activities ranging from student government to dance company.
	My senior year I was voted most friendliest and that made me content with my four years of high school.
	</br>
	I believe my communication skills and my approachable attitude brings a friendly atmosphere to the people around me.
	I am great when it comes to working with others and enjoy learning about people's culture. I can speak English and Spanish fluently.
	For most of my life I was raised by a wonderful, caring, supportive mother. I am the middle child of six children and the oldest boy.
	I danced for about four years, did track for two years, and had asthma ever since kindergarten. I always do my best whether it's in class
	or outside of school. I joined a fraternity at Arizona State University my second semester freshmen year. I have traveled to China and the
	Philippines for spring break. Lastly, I enjoy the little things such as naps.
